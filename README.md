# BEIS SPL Planner

This repository contains the code for the Shared Parental Leave (SPL) and Stautory Shared Parental Pay (ShPP) planner service.

It is built on top of the [BEIS SPL common](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/beis-spl-common) baseline project, which in turn is forked from the [GDS Node.js boilerplate](https://github.com/alphagov/gds-nodejs-boilerplate) project.

##Â Architecture
The application is is purely frontend. There is no backend, no database. An example architecture diagram can be seen in the root folder.

## Getting started on development

### Installs

#### Required
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

#### Recommended

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and these extensions:
  * [Nunjucks VSCode Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=douglaszaltron.nunjucks-vscode-extensionpack)
  * [EditorConfig for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)
  * [StandardJS - JavaScript Standard Style](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chenxsan.vscode-standardjs)
* [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/extensions/) browser extension

### Set up

Clone this code with Git:
```
git clone git@github.com:UKGovernmentBEIS/beis-spl-planner.git
```

Add the common project as a second remote in Git, to pull changes from there when needed:
```
git remote add common git@github.com:UKGovernmentBEIS/beis-spl-common.git
git fetch common
```

Navigate to the root of the project and install NPM packages:
```
npm install
```

### Running the project in development

Once NPM packages have been installed, run the project locally with:
```
npm run dev
```
You should now be able to see the project running at http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.

If you have installed the LiveReload browser extension as above, then you can enable it once on the page. This will cause the page to automatically reload when you make changes to any file.

### Running Playwright tests

- Run `npx playwright install` to setup browsers and playwright dependencies
- Use `npm run test:feature` or `npx playwright install`
  - Add a `--ui` flag to the command to use Playwright GUI
