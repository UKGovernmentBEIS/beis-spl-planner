        Use the calendar below to plan shared parental leave and pay alongside {{ primaryLeaveType }} and paternity leave and pay.

        You can click the cells to select the weeks each parent wants to take as leave. You have 52 week of leave to split between you.

        The {{ primaryName }} must take 2 weeks of {{ primaryLeaveType }} when the child is {{ "born" if isBirth else "placed with you" }}.
        The partner can take an additional 2 weeks as paternity leave in the first 8 weeks after the child is {{ "born" if isBirth else "placed with you" }}.
      </p>
      <p class="print-hide">
        If you're taking more than 39 weeks in total, you can also select which leave weeks are paid and unpaid.

      </p>
      <p class="print-hide">
        For the remaining 33 paid weeks, each parent can get the statutory pay rate of {{ STATUTORY_MAXIMUM_PAY }} per week,
