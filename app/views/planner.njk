        Plan shared parental leave and pay
      </h1>
      <p>
        Use this calendar to plan <a href="https://www.gov.uk/shared-parental-leave-and-pay">shared parental leave and pay</a>
        alongside <a href="https://www.gov.uk/{{ data | primaryLeaveType }}-pay-leave">{{ data | primaryLeaveType }}</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/paternity-pay-leave">paternity</a> leave and pay.
        The calendar is based on {{ "your child’s birth week" if data | isBirth else "the week your child starts living with you"}}.
      </p>
      <p>
        Click the cells to select the weeks each parent wants to take off work, starting with the {{ data | primaryName }}’s {{ data | primaryLeaveType }} leave.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re taking more than 37 weeks of leave, you can also select which leave weeks are paid and unpaid. The statutory pay amount is indicative only.
      </p>

      {% set policyInfo %}
        <p>
          Shared parental leave and pay is created from unused maternity leave and pay.
        </p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">
          How much you can get
        </h2>
        <p>
          Parents can split up to 50 weeks of shared parental leave and 37 weeks of statutory shared parental pay between them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Statutory shared parental pay is £148.68 per week, or 90% of your average weekly earnings, whichever is lower.
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">
          When you can start
        </h2>
        <p>
          You can start shared parental leave any time after the {{ "child’s birth" if data | isBirth else "child starts living with you"}},
          as long as the {{ data | primaryName }} has ended her {{ data | primaryLeaveType }} leave (either by returning to work or committing to an end date in writing).
        </p>
        <p>
          This means the {{ data | secondaryName }} can start shared parental leave while the {{ data | primaryName }} is on {{ data | primaryLeaveType }} leave.
        </p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">
          How you can take it
        </h2>
        <p>
          Both the {{ data | primaryName }} and the {{ data | secondaryName }} can take shared parental leave in blocks, either at the same time or one after the other.
