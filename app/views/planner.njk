        Use this calendar to plan <a href="https://www.gov.uk/shared-parental-leave-and-pay">shared parental leave and pay</a>
        alongside <a href="https://www.gov.uk/{{ primaryLeaveType }}-pay-leave">{{ primaryLeaveType }}</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/paternity-pay-leave">paternity</a> leave and pay.
        The calendar is based on {{ "your child’s birth week" if data | isBirth else "the week your child starts living with you"}}.
      </p>
      <p>
        Click in the calendar to select each week you and your partner want to take as leave.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re taking more than 37 weeks of leave, you can also select which leave weeks are paid and unpaid. The statutory pay amount is indicative only.

          Shared parental leave and pay
        </h2>
        <p>
          Shared parental leave and pay is created from unused {{ primaryLeaveType }} leave and pay.
          Parents can split up to 50 weeks of shared parental leave and 37 weeks of statutory shared parental pay between them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Statutory shared parental pay is always {{ STATUTORY_MAXIMUM }} per week, or 90% of your average weekly earnings, whichever is lower.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can only start shared parental leave and pay after the child's birth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The partner can start shared parental leave and pay while the {{ primaryName }} is on {{ primaryLeaveType }} leave and pay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both the {{ primaryName }} and the partner can take shared parental leave in blocks, either at the same time or one after the other.
        </p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">
          {{ primaryLeaveType | capitalise }} leave and pay
        </h2>
        <p>
          The {{ primaryName }} can take up to 52 weeks of {{ primaryLeaveType }} leave and claim 39 weeks of statutory {{ primaryLeaveType }} pay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Statutory {{ primaryLeaveType }} pay is 90% of the {{ primaryName }}’s average weekly earnings for the first 6 weeks,
          then {{ STATUTORY_MAXIMUM }} per week or 90% of the {{ primaryName }}’s average weekly earnings, whichever is lower.
        </p>
        <p>
          {{ primaryLeaveType | capitalise }} leave and pay must be taken in one continuous block.
          It can start up to {{ "11" if isBirth else "2" }} weeks before the expected week of birth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The {{ primaryName }} must take 2 weeks of compulsory {{ primaryLeaveType }} leave and pay as soon as the child is born.
        </p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">
          Paternity leave and pay
        </h2>
        <p>
          The partner can take 2 weeks of paternity leave. It must be taken within the first 8 weeks after birth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Statutory paternity pay is always {{ STATUTORY_MAXIMUM }} per week, or 90% of your average weekly earnings, whichever is lower.
