        Plan shared parental leave and pay
      </h1>
      <p>
        Use the calendar below to plan shared parental leave and pay alongside {{ primaryLeaveType }} and paternity leave and pay.
        The calendar is based on {{ "your child’s birth week" if isBirth else "the week your child starts living with you"}}.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can click the cells to select the weeks each parent wants to take as leave, starting with the {{ primaryName }}’s {{ primaryLeaveType }} leave.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re taking more than 39 weeks of leave, you can also select which leave weeks are paid and unpaid. The statutory pay amount is indicative only.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">
        How many weeks of leave and pay you can take
      </h2>
      <p>
        Shared parental leave and pay is created from unused {{ primaryLeaveType }} leave and statutory {{ primaryLeaveType }} pay.
        The {{ primaryName }} must take 2 weeks of {{ primaryLeaveType }} leave and pay when the child {{ "is born" if isBirth else "starts living with you"}}.
      </p>
      <p>
        This leaves 50 weeks of leave and 37 weeks of statutory pay for parents to split between them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The partner can take two weeks of paternity leave in addition to this.
      </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">
        How much pay you can get
      </h2>
      <p>
        The {{ primaryName }} gets 90% of their average weekly earnings for the first 6 weeks of
        statutory {{ primaryLeaveType }} pay.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the remaining 33 paid weeks, parents can get the statutory pay rate of {{ STATUTORY_MAXIMUM_PAY }} per week,
        or 90% of their average weekly salary, whichever is lower.
      </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">
        When you can start
      </h2>
      <p>
        The {{ primaryName }} can start {{ primaryLeaveType }} leave up to {{ "11" if isBirth else "2" }}
        weeks before the week of {{ "birth" if isBirth else "placement"}}.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shared parental leave and pay can start after the child’s {{ "birth" if isBirth else "placement" }}.
        The partner can start shared parental leave and pay while the {{ primaryName }} is on {{ primaryLeaveType }} leave.
        The partner can start paternity leave and pay in the first 8 weeks after the child’s {{ "birth" if isBirth else "placement" }}.
      </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">
        Blocks of leave
      </h2>
      <p>
        {{ primaryLeaveType | capitalise }} leave and pay must be taken in one continuous block. Shared parental leave can be taken as three separate blocks, or more if employers allow.
      </p>
