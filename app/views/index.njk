        Plan shared parental leave and pay
      </h1>
      <p>
        This tool allows you and your partner to create a plan for how to take shared parental leave when you have a child.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also generate forms based on your plan to give notice to your employer of your intention to take shared parental leave.
      </p>
      <p>
        Find out:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>how to take shared parental leave alongside maternity, adoption and paternity leave</li>
        <li>how much you’ll be paid while you take leave</li>
        <li>when and how to give notice to your employer</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All weeks in this planning tool start on a Monday and end on a Sunday. You can choose a different day of the week to start your leave when you give notice to your employer.
      </p>
      <p>
        All pay amounts in the tool are statutory and indicative only. Your employer can confirm your exact pay amount.
