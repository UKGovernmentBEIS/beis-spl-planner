                Privacy notice
            </h1>

            <p>This privacy notice explains how the Department for Business and Trade (DBT), as a ‘data controller’, processes personal data for the ‘Plan your Shared Parental Leave and Pay’ service on GOV.UK. </p>
            <p>This notice is supplemented by our <a href="https://www.great.gov.uk/privacy-and-cookies/">main privacy notice</a> which provides further information on how DBT processes personal data and sets out your rights in respect of that personal data.</p>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Personal data DBT collects</h2>
            <p>In this service, DBT collects information about individuals planning Shared Parental Leave and their family members. This service does not collect any personal data that allows the direct identification of an individual (for example names).</p>
            <p>The following categories of personal data are collected:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>Dates of birth</li>
                <li>Salary and employment information</li>
                <li>Details of a child’s birth, adoption or surrogacy</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why DBT asks for this information and what happens if it is not provided</h2>
            <p>Personal data is collected through the ‘Plan your Shared Parental Leave and Pay’ service to enable individuals to check their eligibility for Shared Parental Leave and Shared Parental Pay. This is an optional service that individuals are not required to use.</p>
            <p>DBT collects this information to support individuals and their employers with planning their Shared Parental Leave and Pay, linked to the department’s obligations under the Children and Families Act 2014.</p>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">The legal basis for processing your personal data</h2>
            <p>The legal bases for processing your personal data under (Article 6(1) UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)) are that:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject</li>
                <li>processing is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How DBT processes personal data it receives</h2>
            <p>Data entered into the ‘Plan your Shared Parental Leave and Pay’ service is not stored in any database. It is only held temporarily to enable you to complete your use of the service.</p>
            <p>The data you enter is also converted into a web link, which is made available to you so that you can return to your shared parental leave plan, or share it with others. This web link can be openly accessed by anyone it is shared with, so care should be taken when sharing this link.</p>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Third-party processors</h2>
            <p>We use the following third-party processors to operate the service:</p>

                <li>Google Analytics – used to monitor usage and the performance of DBT digital services</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Information sharing</h2>
            <p>The service does not store your personal data, so there is no onward sharing of information with others.</p>
